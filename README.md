# lightningDetector

This project was created primary for astronomical observatory in Suhora.
A project to detect lightnings in specific area using blitzortung.org service. It is possible to detect lightning strikes around the globe. From my calculations, accuracy is ~5km, and it's good enough for warning systems in non commercial use.
